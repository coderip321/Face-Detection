Face Detection
Detect your face using 5 dots.

## How it works?
In this program, we are using a package called Mediapipe to detect our face. We also use cv2 to capture the frame for face detection. Then we write the code to make the dots move when we move our face. To take the code to the next level, we added a simple feature to stop the program when we hit that button.
